React Video Example
=========================

This is a example of responsive video player using ReactJS. [Check out the live demo](http://jirivrany.github.io/react-video-example/).

Features

* responsive video resize
* seek bar with custom time marks
* video thumbnails on seek bar

Note: Thumbnails are generated simply just in time from video file. No precomputation required. For very large video files and/or slow connections will be of course better to use traditional prerender of thumbnails. 

### Running

Set the video options in config.js and then run:

```
npm install
npm start
```

Point your browser to http://localhost:3000/ and try to resize window.
